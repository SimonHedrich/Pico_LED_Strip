f (Frequency): A higher f value increases the number of color cycles along the strip.
ϕ (Phase Shift): By changing ϕ, users can shift the pattern along the strip. This is useful for creating complex, overlapping patterns.
A (Amplitude): This scales the brightness variation. To fit the LED's input range, ensure that after scaling, the values do not exceed 255 or drop below 0.
C (Color Offset): This shifts the entire color range up or down. It's crucial to ensure that the final value stays within the 0 to 255 range.
Tm (Time Multiplier): Adjusting Tm changes how fast the pattern moves. A higher value makes the pattern change more rapidly with time.
Sm (Spatial Multiplier): This affects the spatial frequency of the pattern along the strip. A higher Sm compresses the pattern, creating more cycles along the strip.
